# calculator
This is a repository for any of my semi-decent projects in python. 
Also this repository does contain other projects as well. As of August 2022, there is also another calculator (not a GUI however) and a hangman game! 
I'll regularly update the README whenever I add a new project so I can track my progress!
If you find an issue or a bug in my code, lmk! Am happy to take any advice. 
P.S. Sorry about the dodgy look on the AC Button in the Tkinter calculator. No idea how to get past that!

UPDATE
13/08/2022
Added delete and square buttons to Tkinter calculator. Final/edited files are called calcguiNEW.py and calcguiNEW.png. Also AC button visual bug resolved.
