# calculator
This is a repository for any of my semi-decent projects in python.
I'll regularly update the README whenever I add a new project or update an old one. 
Thanks, and happy coding!


UPDATE

Added delete and square buttons to Tkinter calculator. Final/edited files are called calcguiNEW.py and calcguiNEW.png. Also AC button visual bug resolved.
