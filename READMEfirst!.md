This is a repository for any of my semi-decent projects in python.
I'll regularly update the README whenever I add a new project or update an old one. 
Thanks, and happy coding!
P.S. I'm coding on a Macbook Pro, so if you're on windows, there will probably be a few visual bugs with Tkinter projects. However they should still work fine!

UPDATE

Added delete and square buttons to Tkinter calculator. Final/edited files are called calcguiNEW.py and calcguiNEW.png. Also AC button visual bug resolved. 
Happy calculating!

UPDATE

Created Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Tkinter. Files are called rock-paper-scissorsgui.py and rock-paperscissorsgui.png. Two labels in the window. The top one simply welcomes the user to the game, and the bottom one displays the result - who won the game, the computer or the user. 
Happy...rock, paper, scissoring, I guess?
