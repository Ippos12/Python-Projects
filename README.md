# calculator
This is a repository for any of my semi-decent projects in python. It's called calculator because the project I am most proud of is my calculator in Tkinter. Despite being barely 40 lines of code, it took a lot of debugging and hard work to finally make it work. Sorry if the AC button on it looks a bit dodgy: not entirely sure how to fix that!
Also this repository does contain other projects as well. As of August 2022, there is also another calculator (not a GUI however) and a hangman game! 
I'll regularly update the README whenever I add a new project so I can track my progress!
If you find an issue or a bug in my code, lmk! Am happy to take any advice.
